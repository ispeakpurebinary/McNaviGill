## (In Progress)
McGill has a network of underground tunnels, most of which the majority of students are unaware of. It can be really challenging to navigate the buildings, especially in the harsh winter and for new students.
We aimed to create a platform that maps all McGill underground tunnels, utilises GPS to track their locations, and provides directions. Students should be able to upload their schedules so 
it can give them directions to their classrooms through the tunnels with time notifications. (e.g, 5 minutes late to COMP 202! Here's the shortest and warmest route:)


## Features:
- Mapping with the integration of outdoor paths, McGill underground tunnels, and indoor routes.
- Offering the options of the optimal route, warmest route, and customised route.
- Finding users by GPS and providing real-time weather information on expected temperatures.
- Establishing bookmarks for the most frequently utilised routes.
- Visualising underground mapping where GPS signal availability is limited.
